Out of the box the following\napplications are supported: Evernote, Mail, Spark and Outlook. You\ncan easily register handlers for new applications (or override the\nbuilt-in ones) using the `registerApplication()` method. If you\nwrite a new handler and feel others could benefit from it, please\nsubmit a pull request!\n\nHandlers can also provide support for archiving to multiple\nlocations, and you can bind different hotkeys for each\ndestination. At the moment only Evernote supports this. See the\ndocumentation for `bindHotkeys()` for the details on how to\nspecify multiple-destination filing hotkeys.",
